## Hi there, I'm Tabatha! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a programmer with a Masters in Mathematics Education. I recently wrapped up my training at Flatiron School where I did Full-Stack Development with Ruby on Rails, React/Redux, JavaScript, and of course HTML/CSS. I began my career as a teacher and through teaching coding, I became passionate about it. I recently got hired for my first tech job as a Junior Software Developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building small CRUD applications to practice my new tech stack.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP, Docker, and Microsoft Azure.
